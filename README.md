# FULL DUPLEX UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)

## ðŸ“– Overview
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) is a widely used serial communication protocol.  
It enables data transfer between devices **bit by bit** over two main lines:  

- **TX (Transmit)** â†’ Sends data  
- **RX (Receive)** â†’ Receives data  

Unlike SPI or IÂ²C, UART is **asynchronous**, meaning no separate clock line is required.  
Both transmitter and receiver must be configured with the **same baud rate** (bits per second).

## âš¡ UART Transmitter
The **transmitter** converts parallel data (e.g., an 8-bit character) into serial form.  

The output data frame in this design consists of:  
- **Start bit** (always `0`)  
- **Data bits** (8 bits, LSB first)  
- **Stop bit** (always `1`)

## âš¡ UART Receiver
The **receiver** listens to the RX line, detects the **start bit**, and samples each bit at the given baud rate.  
It reconstructs the original parallel data once all 8 data bits are received.
